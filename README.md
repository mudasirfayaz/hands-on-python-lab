## Hands-On Python Lab

A curated set of practical Python mini-projects created to reinforce essential programming concepts through hands-on experience. Projects range from beginner to intermediate level, each focusing on real-world applications and problem-solving.

<br/>

## Repository Overview üöÄ

- **Self-contained projects:** Each project is in its own folder for easy navigation.
- **Clear documentation:** Every project includes a `README.md` with usage and concept details.
- **Concept-focused:** Projects cover Python basics, data structures, OOP, and input validation.
- **Real-world examples:** Includes games and utility scripts for practical learning.
- **Continuously updated:** New projects are added as learning progresses.

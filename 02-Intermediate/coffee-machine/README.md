# ☕ Coffee Machine CLI

> A simple Python-based command-line interface (CLI) that simulates the behavior of a coffee vending machine. It supports three types of drinks — **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino** — and handles coin transactions, resource management, and change calculation.

<br/>

## Features

- Interactive CLI for drink selection
- Resource availability checks
- Coin-based payment system with change return
- Real-time inventory and financial reporting
- Modular code with clean separation of data and logic

<br/>

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced in This Project

- Dictionaries (nested structures)
- Functions & modular programming
- Loops ─ `while`, `for`
- Conditional logic
- User input handling

<br/>

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required

<br/>

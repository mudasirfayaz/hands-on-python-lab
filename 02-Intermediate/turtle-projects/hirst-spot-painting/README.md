# 🟢 Hirst Spot Painting

> A creative dot-art generator built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Inspired by the famous Hirst dot paintings, this tool lets you draw colorful, randomized dot grids — fully customizable in size, spacing, and palette.

> <br/>

## 🎯 Features

- Draws evenly spaced dot grids using Turtle graphics
- Randomizes dot colors from a pre-defined or image-extracted color palette
- Supports customization for:
  - Number of rows & columns
  - Dot size
  - Spacing between dots
  - Custom color palettes

<br/>

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced in This Project

- Turtle graphics & GUI drawing
- Coordinate system and positioning
- Loops and nested iteration
- RGB color manipulation
- Function modularization and parameterization

<br/>

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Built-in modules:
  - `turtle` — to create drawings and animations
  - `random` — for number generation

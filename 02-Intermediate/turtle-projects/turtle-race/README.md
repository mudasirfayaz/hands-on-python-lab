# Turtle Race 🐢

> A fun and interactive turtle graphics game where 6 colorful turtles race across the screen. Users place a bet on which turtle color will win — and then watch the race unfold!

<br/>

## Project Overview

This mini-project is built using Python's built-in `turtle` module and showcases:

- Object creation and management (`Turtle()` instances)
- User interaction through input dialogs (`screen.textinput()`)
- Simple game logic with win conditions
- Randomized movement using the `random` module

<br/>

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Turtle graphics & screen setup
- Object lists and loop-based initialization
- `penup()` positioning logic
- User input via dialog box
- `xcor()` checking for goal completion
- Conditional result logic
- Random integer generation for movement

<br/>

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Built-in modules:
  - `turtle` — to create drawings and animations
  - `random` — for number generation

<br/>

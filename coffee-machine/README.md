# ☕ Coffee Machine CLI

> A simple Python-based command-line interface (CLI) that simulates the behavior of a coffee vending machine. It supports three types of drinks — **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino** — and handles coin transactions, resource management, and change calculation.

<br/>

## Features

- Interactive CLI for drink selection
- Resource availability checks
- Coin-based payment system with change return
- Real-time inventory and financial reporting
- Modular code with clean separation of data and logic

<br/>

## 🧠 Concepts Reinforced in This Project

- Dictionaries (nested structures)
- Functions & modular programming
- Loops ─ `while`, `for`
- Conditional logic
- User input handling

<br/>

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required

<br/>

## 💻 How to Run

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mudasirfayaz/hands-on-python-lab.git
cd hands-on-python-lab/02-Intermediate/coffee-machine
```

**2. Run the script:**

```bash
python main.py
```

<br/>

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have Python 3 installed and accessible from your terminal or command prompt.

<br/>

# Snake Game 🐍

> Enjoy a classic **Snake Game** crafted with Python's `turtle` graphics. Steer the snake using arrow keys, eat food to grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls or yourself!

<br/>

## ✨ Features

- Classic snake movement and growth
- Save and display high scores
- Random food generation
- Collision detection with walls and self
- Simple keyboard controls
- Modular code structure
- Easy to customize and extend

<br/>

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

This project solidifies core Python and OOP concepts:

- Classes, methods, and encapsulation
- `turtle` graphics and animation loops
- Keyboard event handling
- Collision detection (`distance()`)
- Clean modular architecture

<br/>

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Built-in modules:
  - `turtle` — to create drawings and animations
  - `random` — for food generation at random locations
  - `time` — to slow down the drawing actions of the snake

<br/>

## 💻 How to Run

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mudasirfayaz/hands-on-python-lab.git
cd hands-on-python-lab/snake-game
```

**2. Run the script:**

```bash
python main.py
```

<br/>

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have Python 3 installed and accessible from your terminal or command prompt.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **arrow keys** to control the snake:
  - `↑` Up
  - `↓` Down
  - `←` Left
  - `→` Right
- Eat the yellow food dots to grow longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail.

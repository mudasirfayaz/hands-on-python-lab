# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

> Enter any word, and this interactive Python tool will display its NATO phonetic alphabet representation. Leveraging Pandas for CSV processing, the project makes learning and practicing phonetic code words engaging and educational.

<br/>

## How It Works 🎯

When you input a word, the program reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file and builds a dictionary mapping each letter to its code word. It then converts your word into the corresponding phonetic code words and displays them for easy learning.

<br/>

## Key Concepts

- Using pandas to read CSV files
- Creating dictionaries with comprehensions in Python
- Looping through DataFrames
- Employing list comprehensions
- Handling user input
